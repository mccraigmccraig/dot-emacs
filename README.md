Sam Aaron's dot emacs
=====================

This initially started off as a clone of the emacs starter-kit but has now grown its own identity. Currently it's in a state of liminality - perhaps this will never change...

To Install:

* Clone repo and place in ~/.emacs.d
* Run `git submodule init` then `git submodule update`
* Ensure `~/.ercpass` exists. Should look like `(setq freenode-pass "password")`
